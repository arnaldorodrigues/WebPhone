# WebRTC Backend Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration of functionality from the WebRTC-backend project to the WebPhone Next.js project.

## Overview

The WebRTC-backend was a separate Express.js application that provided API endpoints for extension number management. These endpoints have been migrated to Next.js API routes within the WebPhone project, eliminating the need for a separate backend service.

## Migrated Functionality

### API Routes

The following API routes have been migrated:

1. **GET /api/en** - Retrieves all extension numbers from the FusionPBX database
2. **GET /api/en/registered** - Retrieves all registered extension numbers from FreeSWITCH
3. **GET /api/en/registered/[extension]** - Checks if a specific extension is registered with FreeSWITCH

### Tests

Comprehensive tests have been created for each API route:

1. **GET /api/en** - Tests for database queries, error handling, and empty result sets
2. **GET /api/en/registered** - Tests for FreeSWITCH connections, error handling, and parsing responses
3. **GET /api/en/registered/[extension]** - Tests for checking specific extensions, parameter validation, and error handling

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies

The following dependencies were added to the WebPhone project:

- `pg` - PostgreSQL client for database connections

The `modesl` package was already included in the WebPhone project.

### Type Definitions

A new type definition file was created to share types across the API routes:

- `src/types/esl.ts` - Contains interfaces for ESL responses, connections, and database query results

### Environment Variables

The API routes use the following environment variables:

- `DB_HOST` - PostgreSQL database host (default: "127.0.0.1")
- `DB_PORT` - PostgreSQL database port (default: "5432")
- `DB_USER` - PostgreSQL database user (default: "fusionpbx")
- `DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL database password
- `DB_NAME` - PostgreSQL database name (default: "fusionpbx")
- `FS_HOST` - FreeSWITCH host (default: "127.0.0.1")
- `FS_PORT` - FreeSWITCH port (default: "8021")
- `FS_PASSWORD` - FreeSWITCH password (default: "ClueCon")

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified Architecture** - Eliminated the need for a separate backend service
2. **Reduced Deployment Complexity** - Only one application needs to be deployed
3. **Improved Developer Experience** - All code is in a single repository
4. **Better Type Safety** - Leveraging TypeScript throughout the application
5. **Enhanced Testing** - Comprehensive tests for all API routes

## Next Steps

1. Update any client-side code that was calling the WebRTC-backend to use the new Next.js API routes
2. Verify that all functionality works correctly in the integrated environment
3. Remove the WebRTC-backend project if it's no longer needed
4. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
